# AWSM: AWS CLI Helper Tool

AWSM is a command-line helper tool designed to streamline routine AWS tasks like syncing local files with an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket, and establishing SSH connections with EC2 instances.

## üöÄ Installation

Before you start using AWSM, ensure you have Python and necessary modules installed on your machine.

```bash
git clone <your-repo-link>
cd awsm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuring Path

Add `awsm` to your path in `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path-to-awsm-directory"
```

### Configurations

Ensure your configurations for each project are in `config.json` within the `awsm` directory.

Example `config.json`:

```json
{
  "market-intelligence": {
    "PEM_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/pem/file",
    "EC2_USER": "ec2-user",
    "REPO_DIR_NAME": "repo-dir-name",
    "APP_DIR_PATH": "/app/dir/path",
    "REPO_DIR_PATH": "/repo/dir/path",
    "EC2_ADDRESS": "ec2-address"
  }
  ...
}
```
