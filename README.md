# AWSM: AWS CLI Helper Tool

AWSM is a command-line helper tool designed to streamline routine AWS tasks like syncing local files with an EC2 instance or an S3 bucket, and establishing SSH connections with EC2 instances.

## üöÄ Installation

Before you start using AWSM, ensure you have Python and necessary modules installed on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xhankoc/awsm
cd awsm
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuring Path

Add `awsm` to your path in `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`:

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:/path-to-awsm-directory"
```

### Configurations

Create an `awsm_config.json` file in your project directory. 

Depending on which AWS infra (EC2 / S3) the project is using, fill out the
following fields in the project config file named `awsm_config.json`:
```json
{
  "market-intelligence": {
    "ec2": {
      "PEM_FILE_PATH": "/path/to/pem/file",
      "EC2_USER": "ec2-user",
      "REPO_DIR_NAME": "repo-dir-name",
      "APP_DIR_PATH": "/app/dir/path",
      "REPO_DIR_PATH": "/repo/dir/path",
      "EC2_ADDRESS": "ec2.address.here"
    },
    "s3": {
      "S3_BUCKET": "s3_bucket_name",
      "REPO_DIR_NAME": "name_of_directory",
      "REPO_DIR_PATH": "/local/path/to/project/files"
